# Setup
You need to follow steps 1-4 before you have a working copy of the project.

## 1. Clone this repo:

Navigate into your workspace directory.

Run:

```
git clone git@github.com:benjaminboruff/blasteroids.git
```

## 2. Install node.js :

https://nodejs.org/en/

## 3. Install yarn :

https://yarnpkg.com/

## 4. Install dependencies :

Navigate to the cloned repoâ€™s directory.

Run:

```
yarn
```

## 5. Run the development server:

Run:

```
yarn dev
```

This will run a server so you can run the game in a browser.

Open your browser and enter localhost:3000 into the address bar.

Also this will start a watch process, so you can change the source and the process will recompile and refresh the browser


## 6. Build for deployment:

Run:

```
yarn build
```

This will optimize and minimize the compiled bundle.
